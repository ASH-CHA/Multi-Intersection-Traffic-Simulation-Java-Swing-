# Multi-Intersection-Traffic-Simulation-Java-Swing-
This project is a Java Swing–based traffic simulation that models cars moving through multiple intersections controlled by traffic lights. Each traffic light cycles through red, yellow, and green states on timed intervals, while cars respond dynamically to the light color by stopping or proceeding forward.
